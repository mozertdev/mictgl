Thank you for your interest in contributing! I welcome and appreciate all contributions, whether they are bug reports, new features, or creative themes. Your help is essential to making this project better for everyone.

Before you begin, please take a moment to read this guide to understand our workflow and standards.

## Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please help us by reporting it. A good bug report is crucial for a quick resolution.

1. **Check existing issues:** Search the issue tracker to see if the bug has already been reported. If it has, you can add your comments and details to the existing issue.

2. **Open a new issue:** If the bug hasn't been reported, open a new issue.

3. **Provide detailed information:** When creating the issue, please include as much detail as possible, such as:
   
   - A clear and descriptive title.
   
   - Steps to reproduce the bug.
   
   - Your operating system and any relevant software versions.
   
   - Expected behavior vs. actual behavior.
   
   - Screenshots or videos (if applicable).

## Suggesting New Features or Enhancements

Have an idea for a new feature or a way to improve an existing one? I'd love to hear it!

1. **Check existing issues:** Look for similar feature requests in the issue tracker. If one already exists, you can add your support or new ideas to the conversation.

2. **Open a new issue:** If it's a new idea, please open a new issue.

3. **Describe your suggestion:** Clearly explain the feature or enhancement, why it would be beneficial, and how you envision it working.

## Creating New Themes

To encourage creativity and to make it easy for you to add your own flair to the project. You can contribute new icon and sound effect themes.

### Icon Themes

To create a new icon theme, follow these guidelines:

1. **Create a theme directory:** Inside the main themes directory, create a new folder named after your theme (e.g., `my-cool-theme`).

2. **Add size subdirectories:** Inside your theme folder, create three subdirectories named `32x32`, `48x48`, and `64x64`.

3. **Create the SVG files:** In each of these size-specific folders, you must include three SVG files with the exact names:
   
   - `microphone-active.svg`
   
   - `microphone-muted.svg`
   
   - `microphone-error.svg`

4. **File requirements:**
   
   - The files must be **plain SVG** format.
   
   - Each SVG file must have the correct dimensions corresponding to its directory (e.g., `microphone-active.svg` in the `32x32` folder must be a 32x32 pixel SVG).

### Sound Effect Themes

To create a new sound effect theme, follow these guidelines:

1. **Create a theme directory:** Inside the main themes directory, create a new folder named after your theme (e.g., `my-sound-theme`).

2. **Create the audio files:** Inside this folder, you must include three WAV files with the exact names:
   
   - `microphone-active.wav`
   
   - `microphone-muted.wav`
   
   - `microphone-error.wav`

3. **File requirements:**
   
   - The files must be **WAV** format.
   
   - The sounds should be evocative and convey the state's "feeling" without requiring visual cues.
   
   - The sounds must be distinct from each other.
   
   - They should ideally not last longer than 1 or 2 seconds.
   
   - A 16-bit audio standard is preferred.
